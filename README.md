# PatioUmbrella
For my MIE301 Kinematics course, my team created a novel design to reduce the force applied by the user to deploy the umbrella. I created a MATLAB simulation to:
 - Animate the motion of the mechanism for the three controls
    - Canopy Angle
    - Canopy Height
    - Opening and Closing the Umbrella
  - Optimize the weights of the two counterweight links in order to minimize input force
  - Calculate canopy centre of mass for calculating lead-screw pitch

You will need _MATLAB_ or _GNU Octave_ to run the code. I have not tested it on _GNU Octave_ yet.
